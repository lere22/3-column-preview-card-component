## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

What I learned from creating the project 3-column preview card component is understanding using max-width with "ch" units. The result is good and close to the design that has been given, but I still try to adjust it and try to use it better for next project.

### Continued development

I want to continue this project to collaborate with my other projects in the future.
